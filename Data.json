In time, the tools developed by advanced adversaries become available to less sophisticated adversaries. Therefore, systems and missions need to be resilient in the face of unexpected attacks. Guidance: Incorporate an adversarial perspective when analyzing architectural changes, design modifications, and changes in operational procedures and governance structures. Use cyber threat intelligence (CTI) but do not be limited by it—take a longer-term view, and expect the threat landscape to continue to change."
